TS House styles NKD
====================

A bare-bones version of Tangent Snowball's house styles repository for rapid prototyping  

This repository is based on the [TS House Styles](https://github.com/tangentsnowball/house-styles)


There is a `gulpfile.js` within this repository to make development much quicker for the house styles. All you need to do is:  
* Install Node (http://nodejs.org) & Gulp (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)  
* Run `npm install`  
This will install all the dependencies found in `package.json` (The `node_modules` folder that is generated when you run this command should be created on a case-by-case basis and not pushed to a repository)  
* Run `gulp`  
  
This will open up a tab in your browser, running a server at `localhost:3000` (unless you have set up a proxy server address - details on how to change this are in the `gulpfile.js` file).

### BrowserSync  
  
The main component of this Gulp setup is BrowserSync. This plugin provides the following advantages for development:  
* Simultaneous page scrolling for all devices connected to the same link  
* Clicking links or populating form fields on one device will duplicate this behaviour on all other linked devices  
* A dashboard at `localhost:3001` where you can send commands to all connected devices, perform actions and do network throttle testing.
